# LegalDoc AI: Intelligent Document Analysis Framework

An engineering-inspired NLP framework designed to classify, analyze, and visualize scope-limited legal documents. This project leverages **Lawformer** (Legal-BERT) for semantic understanding and **Graph Theory** for information density optimization.



## 🚀 Key Engineering Pillars

### 1. Vector Space Model (VSM) Classifier
Documents are numerically represented in a high-dimensional space. The system calculates the **Cosine Proximity** between the document vector and domain centroids (Criminal, Contract, Education) to perform automated classification.

### 2. Graph Centrality Word Clouds
Unlike standard frequency-based clouds, our system builds a **Co-occurrence Graph** of legal terms. **Degree Centrality** is used to identify semantically "influential" terms, which are then passed to our visualization engine.

### 3. Greedy Knapsack Selection
To manage "Information Density," the system treats terms as items in a Knapsack problem. It selects the most "valuable" terms (highest centrality) that fit within a limited visual "budget," preventing UI clutter.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python), PyMuPDF, NetworkX, PyTorch, Lawformer (Transformers)
- **Frontend:** React 19, Vite, Material UI, Zustand, React-TagCloud


## 📅 Project Management & Task Distribution

The development of **LegalDoc AI** followed a 15-week structured timeline, utilizing parallel task processing to ensure seamless integration between NLP models and the frontend interface.
